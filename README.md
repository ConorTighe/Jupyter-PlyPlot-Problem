# Problem set: Jupyter, pyplot and numpy

This repo contains the solutions to [problem sheet 3](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/jupyter.html) for emerging technologies along with explanations to the solutions using jupyter notebook. 

## Introduction:
This repository imports, inspects and manipulates the IRIS dataset which contains data on species of flowers. When you first run the notebook you will see the whole IRIS dataset being imported through numpy. This is displayed in the notebook and we then analysis the data shown. We go on to divide the data with the pandas library and plot it using seaborn and pyplot.

## The librays and there uses within the notebook:

    - Numpy: For maths functions.
    - Pandas: For working with CSVs and there individual columns.
    - Pyplot: For ploting the data imported and the resulting calculations onto graphs.
    - Seaborn: An extention of pyplot for generating more complex graphs and calculations.
    
## The dataset:
I included the CSV containing the IRIS dataset used for this problem sheet, an analysis is provided in the notebook.

## Setup:

Download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ConorTighe1995/Jupyter-PlyPlot-Problem.git

```

Navigate to the downoaded repo and run Jupyter:

```
