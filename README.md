## The librays and there uses within the notebook:

    - Numpy: For maths functions.
    - Pandas: For working with CSVs and there individual columns.
    - Pyplot: For ploting the data imported and the resulting calculations onto graphs.
    - Seaborn: An extention of pyplot for generating more complex graphs and calculations.
